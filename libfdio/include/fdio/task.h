/*
 * This file provides the API to running a function in the context of the
 * poll loop.
 *
 * The task queue must be initialized using |init_task_queue|. It should
 * be called from within the init function that is supplied to |epoll_loop|.
 *
 * The function |run_task| dispatches an event to the poll loop that executes
 * the function 'func' with the supplied user data as argument.
 *
 * This interface is _not_ thread-safe, except for |run_task|.

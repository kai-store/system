This is a quick quide on how to port bluetoothd to a new Android
release.

1) To port bluetoothd to a new release of Android, update the makefile
   in src/ to include support for the new release.

2) If Bluedroid interfaces changed or you want to support new features,
   you'll have to update the HAL protocol.

2a) First pick a version of the HAL protocol at

  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/android/hal-ipc-api.txt

2b) Implement support for this version *without* breaking support for
    older releases. Bluetoothd uses a specific version of the HAL protocol
    for each Android release. That ensures long-term stability portability.

3) Submit your changes to Mozilla for inclusion in the official source
   code repository. If you're unsure how to do this, you can ask in

     dev-bluetooth@lists.mozilla.org

   or

     dev-b2g@lists.mozilla.org

   about the current procedure.
